# MATLAB-Excel-to-Word
MATLAB script that replaces placeholders in .docx with data stored in .xlsx.

Points to take into consideration:

-  Expression replacement is case sensitive. Make sure to input exactly the same expression as it is set in your Word document.
-  This script assumes that the first column in your Excel is how you will want to name every saved file.

Feel free to make any changes.
