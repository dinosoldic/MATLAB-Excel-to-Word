# MATLAB-Excel-to-Word
MATLAB script that replaces placeholders in .docx with data stored in .xlsx. Once done, asves as word document with custom name and includes option to save as .pdf.

Points to take into consideration:

-  Expression replacement is case sensitive. Make sure to input exactly the same expression as it is set in your Word document.
-  This script assumes that the first column in your Excel is how you will want to name every saved file.
-  Currently supports General and Numeric formats from Excel. Others such as date, etc. may not work as intended.

Feel free to make any changes.
